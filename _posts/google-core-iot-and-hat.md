# An End-to-End Demonstrationg of Sending Temperature Messages from a Raspberry Pi HAT via MQTT to Google Core IoT

## Introduction

One of our earliest examples involved showing a user how they could take their IoT project online through [Google Core IoT]({{site.url}}/blog/tutorials/google-core-iot) using their [MQTT sample code](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/master/iot/api-client/mqtt_example). We encourage you to check this out first before going through this example here.
