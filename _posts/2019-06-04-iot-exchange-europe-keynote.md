<h3>
IBM IoT Exchange is an intensive conference presenting leaders in operations, buildings and product engineering. Experts from around the globe will present how the effective use of data and AI is transforming business operations. Organizations that extract full value from the data they capture are making strides in virtually every industry, and claiming leadership position against their competitors. You don’t want to be left behind.
</h3>
<p>
An event designed to help you realize value—now
With over 40 seminars in four academies, you’ll find many presentations specifically geared to your industry, your issues, and your goals. Additionally, acclaimed IBM speaker, Andy Bennett, will conduct a keynote address in which he presents industry experts and asks them about the technologies and trends that are transforming organizations.

Keynote to host experts in operational transformation
IoT data and AI are helping businesses operate more efficiently and effectively, and innovate quickly at a lower cost. Andy Bennett, Worldwide Sales Leader of IBM Watson IoT, will discuss how these new technologies are changing the way we maintain, operate and engineer physical assets to optimize performance, reduce costs, and gain a competitive edge. Additionally, he’ll introduce and ask questions of experts in three key areas: Enterprise Asset Management (EAM), Facilities Operation, and Engineering.
 </p>
 <p>
Global experts reveal how IoT data and AI are driving change
During these keynote discussions, you’ll learn how EAM is evolving, why companies need to think about maintenance differently, and how they can balance costs with risks and performance. You’ll also learn why so many companies are over-maintaining their assets, and how it negatively affects their operational performance.
 </p>
 <p>
Then, an expert in Facilities Operations will discuss why energy consumption and optimization has become so important for facilities, and how global costs and regulations make real-time analytics for facilities management so important to every organization. When companies are spending up to 10K British Pounds per employee for space, optimization becomes essential.
 </p>
 <p>
Finally, you’ll hear how consumer demand is forcing engineers to create connected products that are meaningful to Millennials. Software-centric products with embedded systems are changing the development process, and organizations must now rely on IoT and AI to keep up with market expectations.
 </p>
 <p>
This keynote address will provide timely information about trends, and introduce solutions you’ll learn more about in sessions in our three academies: Engineering Academy, TRIRIGA® Academy and Maximo® Academy.
