<span class="t_m1">FAQ</span>
<h1 id="dashboard-faq">Dashboard FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="what-are-default-credentials-">What are default credentials? <a name="default-credentials"></a></h2>
<p>Default credentials are credentials (usually username/password combinations), such as admin/admin that device producers put in during manufacturing. These are intended to be temporary and changed by the user as soon as possible. In reality however, many users fail to change this, leaving the device(s) vulnerable to attackers.</p>

<p>Default credentials are usually attributed to one of the biggest problems in IoT, and enabled malware like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">Mirai</a> to spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>WoTT will automatically scan your devices for default credentials. We have built a database that includes not only data set that Marai used (to ensure you won’t get compromised), but also additional credentials we’ve found to be common.</p>

<p>If the WoTT Dashboard displays a warning that default credentials were find, we strongly recommend that you quickly resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Default credentials will lower your device’s Trust Score.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-selinux-">What is SELinux? <a name="selinux"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page">SELinux</a>, short for Security Enhanced Linux, provides more granular access control to Linux. You can use this to limit what your applications can and cannot do, such that if the application were to get compromised, the attacker be restricted in what they. For instance, you can configure what network resources and interprocess communication (IPC) the application can use.</p>

<p>The possible modes in WoTT’s dashboard are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disabled</li>
  <li>Enabled</li>
  <li>Enforcing</li>
</ul>

<p>(Where Enforcing is will give you the best Trust Score).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-apparmor-">What is AppArmor? <a name="apparmor"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor">AppArmor</a> is similar to SELinux, and also provides more granular access control for processes. It is for instance heavily leverage in <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core">Ubuntu Core</a> to confine what a particular application can and cannot do.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you either use AppArmor <em>or</em> SELinux (not both) for the best security posture of your device.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-firewall-policy-">What is Firewall Policy? <a name="firewall-policy"></a></h2>
<p>A firewall can be configured with two default policies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accept by default</li>
  <li>Deny by default</li>
</ul>

<p>If you select “Accept by default,” all inbound communication is allowed unless explicitly blocked. With a “Deny by default” all incoming traffic is blocked, unless explicitly allowed.</p>

<p>The most secure firewall configuration is “Deny by default.”</p>

<h2 id="what-are-open-connections-">What are open connections? <a name="open-connections"></a></h2>
<p>Open connections are network connections (incoming or outgoing) reported by the WoTT agent during the last run. We monitor this on an ongoing basis in order to determine what the normal behavior of the device is. Contrary to a workstation, an IoT device tend to have very predictable network operations. Hence, by monitoring the network behavior for abnormalities, we are able to find potentially malicious activities.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-device-certificate-">What is a device certificate? <a name="device-certificate"></a></h2>
<p>A device certificate is the public part of the cryptographic identity of a device (the private part is called a “private key”). Using the device certificate, you are able to perform cryptographic operations that only the device in possiosion of the private key can decrypt or interact with.</p>

<p>An example of how this can be used is found in our <a href="https://wott.io/tutorials/2019/06/14/google-core-iot">Google Core IoT example</a>, where we uploaded the device certificate to Google, in order to grant the device access to talk to the Google’s IoT services. In that example, the device used its private key to prove its identity.</p>

<p>The URL found in the dashboard is permanent, and you will always be able to download the latest certificate, but it is recommended that you do this programatically due to the short life span of the certificates. An example of this can be found <a href="https://github.com/WoTTsecurity/google-core-iot">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-device-id-">What is Device ID? <a name="device-id"></a></h2>
<p>The Device ID, also known as the WoTT Device ID, is the unique identifier in WoTT. When creating policies, like in our <a href="https://wott.io/blog/tutorials/2019/07/15/mtls-with-nginx">Nginx + Appserver example</a>, this is the identity we use for each device. Because this is a cryptographic identity, you are able to issue challenges to the device and be certain that the device is what it claims to be.</p>

<h2 id="what-an-fqdn-">What an FQDN? <a name="fqdn"></a></h2>
<p>An FQDN, or Fully Qualified Domain Name, is the hostname that the system itself has been given. This can either be a private name (like my-device.local) or a public name (like my-device.company.com). An FQDN is used to identify the device on a network.</p>

<h1 id="agent-faq">Agent FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="what-operating-systems-does-the-wott-agent-support-">What Operating Systems does the WoTT agent support? <a name="wott-operating-system"></a></h2>
<p>Currently the WoTT Agent can only be installed on Debian package distributions of Linux such as Debian itself or Rasbpian for Pi. This is because the WoTT Agent installation requires Debian packages (<code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code>); although we are working on adding new systems- your favourite Linux distro will be added soon.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-a-wott-dashboard-account-to-use-the-wott-agent-">Do I need a WoTT Dashboard account to use the WoTT Agent? <a name="do-i-need-dashboard"></a></h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, no; you will still have access to the certificates. However, we <em>highly</em> reccommend registering and using the Dashboard as it will give you access to WoTT’s credential management which is useful in securing web and browser based applications. The Dash provides a user friendly interface where you can easily visualise and monitor your devices as well as seeing what security risks your devices have and how to fix them. Additionally, the WoTT Dashboard is free to use, you just need to register with your email.</p>

<h2 id="ive-installed-the-wott-agent-now-what-">I’ve installed the WoTT Agent, now what? <a name="steps-after-installation"></a></h2>
<p>Firstly, thank you for installing the Agent and welcome to the world of security conscious IoT developers! If you need some inspiration, head to our Use Cases page. You’ll find a list of use cases and examples utilising both our CA provided certificates and Dashboard managed credentials. We’ve included examples of some popular cloud services which you may already have projects on and how to secure them.</p>

<h2 id="is-wott-open-source-">Is WoTT Open Source? <a name="wott-open-source"></a></h2>

<p>Yes, the WoTT agent is licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.</p>

<h2 id="im-a-developer-and-want-to-modify-your-codecant-run-virtualenv-">I’m a developer and want to modify your code/can’t run virtualenv <a name="developing-for-wott-language)"></a></h2>

<p>The WoTT Agent is written in Python 3. You will need the relevant libraries to create virtual environments, in this case <code class="highlighter-rouge">venv</code> not <code class="highlighter-rouge">virtualenv</code>. Linux by default comes with Python 2.7 installed- install <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip3</code> using <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get</code> to get access to <code class="highlighter-rouge">venv</code> to create your own virtual environments; and when running applications that use WoTT Agent, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">python3</code>. Additionally any modifications you wish to make must also be in Python 3.</p>
