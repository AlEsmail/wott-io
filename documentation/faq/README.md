## What Operating Systems does the WoTT agent support? <a name="1"></a>
Currently the WoTT agent can only be installed on Debian package distributions such as Raspbian or Debian. This is because the WoTT Agent uses Debian packages (`apt` and `dpkg`); although we are working on adding new systems so watch this space, your favourite Linux distro will be added soon.
